## 📌 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates **new and original content** by learning from existing data. Unlike traditional AI that focuses on analysis and prediction, generative AI produces:

- Text (e.g., articles, emails, poetry)
- Images (artwork, product designs)
- Code (auto-completion, generation)
- Music, videos, and more

## ⚙️ How Does Generative AI Work?

Generative AI typically follows these three steps:

1. **Training on Data**  
   It learns from large datasets like text, images, and audio.
   
2. **Learning Patterns**  
   It understands styles, grammar, structure, and logic within that data.

3. **Generating Output**  
   When given a prompt, it creates brand-new content that mimics what it has learned.

🖼️ Example: A prompt like *“A futuristic city skyline at sunset with flying cars”* can generate a complete, original image using tools like DALL·E.
