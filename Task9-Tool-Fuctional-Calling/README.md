# 🧠 Tool Calling | Function Calling

> The future of AI isn’t just about generating answers—it’s about **taking intelligent actions**.

Agentic AI is ushering in a new era: AI that can reason, plan, and use tools to achieve real-world goals. At the core of this revolution are two key concepts:

- **Tool Calling**
- **Function Calling**

---

## 🤖 What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to models that act as **digital agents**—not just chatbots. They can:

- **Make decisions**
- **Call tools or APIs**
- **Chain multiple steps**
- **Think and act like human assistants**

---

## 🛠️ What Is Function Calling?

**Function calling** lets an LLM (like GPT) call functions based on user input. You define the function’s name, description, and parameters.

<summary>Example</summary>

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "parameters": {
        "city": "Lahore"
    }
}
```
</details>

> The model doesn’t run the code—it returns the function name and arguments.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Safe and controlled
- ✅ Structured input/output
- ✅ Connects AI to backend logic

## 🧰 What Is Tool Calling?

**Tool calling** is a broader concept used in agent frameworks. A tool can be:

- An API
- A Python script
- A web search agent
- Even another LLM

Tools are actions the agent can take. Tool calling lets agents use these tools based on internal reasoning.

## 🔄 Tool Calling vs. Function Calling

| Feature           | Function Calling            | Tool Calling                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Scope**         | Calls single functions      | Calls APIs, scripts, databases, etc.|
| **Who Uses It?**  | GPT via OpenAI API          | Agents (LangChain, AutoGPT, etc.)   |
| **Execution**     | Backend executes function   | External tool runs via planning     |
| **Chaining Steps**| Single step                 | Multi-step reasoning                |
| **Abstraction**   | Low                         | High (tools = agent capabilities)   |

## 💡 Why It Matters

In agent-based workflows, you want AI to:

1. **Decide what needs to be done**
2. **Use the right tools**
3. **Chain steps together**
4. **Respond to outcomes**

Tool calling bridges the gap between **thought** and **action**.

---

## 📝 Example Task: “Plan my weekend in Murree”

1. Get weather info
2. Search hotels
3. Create itinerary
4. Add to calendar
5. Send email

Each step uses a different tool—the agent reasons and executes them in sequence.

---

## 🔧 Real-World Use Cases

- ChatGPT Plugins
- LangChain Agents
- AI Copilots
- Smart Home Systems

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

- **Function Calling** is a mechanism.
- **Tool Calling** is a strategy.

Combined in agent frameworks, they enable truly intelligent systems that both **understand** and **act**.
